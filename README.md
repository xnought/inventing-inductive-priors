# inventing-inductive-priors

Inductive priors (like convolutions, residual connections, batch normalization, attention/transformer) are the drivers behind deep learning. 

We don't see massive vanilla neural networks doing anywhere close to the same performance.

Instead of waiting for a groundbreaking paper with a new inductive prior, let's invent some automatically! Inductive prior search!

**Goals**

- [ ] Verify it could work: simple brute force search example
- [ ] Verify it works well: rediscover existing inductive priors (Convolutions or attention)
- [ ] Invent: new inductive priors with program search/synthesis
